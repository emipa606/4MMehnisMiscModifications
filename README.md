Adds various settings to customise your RimWorld experience.

# FEATURES

- Bugfixes for vanilla issues
The game gives up on sending you manhunter packs once you reach a certain size. No more!

- Extend the time for pawns to undraft themselves
Stay where I put you!
Ever had colonists auto undraft themselves while positioning them? Not anymore.

- Change the threshold at which pawns retreat
Raiders flee at 50% by default. That's boring. Let's randomise the flee threshold.
Want a bigger challenge? Turn off fleeing entirely. Want a laid back game? Set it lower!
Want unpredictability? There's a slider for however much randomness you can suffer.
PS: doesn't work with those kamikaze groups which will fight until last person standing.

- Get an alert when the Nutrient Paste Dispenser can't be used
Pawns won't eat Nutrient Paste for some reason? Odds are there's a chunk blocking access to the interaction spot. 4M gives you a warning if this is the case.

**Information improvements**
- Show what pawns are in a relationship when assigning beds
- Show more info on plant yield (Thanks XeoNovaDan!)
- Show DPS info for all (modded) weapons (Thanks XeoNovanDan!)
- Disable messages for dying animals - who cares about Chicken #357 dying?
- Confirmation dialog before starting if currently viewed colonist isn't selected for embark
- ~~Better raider visibility. No more ninja mechanoids! All hostiles will have their label draw in red, whether they're a raider, mechanoid or hostile animal.~~ (Removed in 1.4, please use [Atomic Patches - Hostile Labels](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2904510148) instead)
- Chased refugees will give a full headcount of their raid.
- Add item information buttons at item filter.

**Various (AI) tweaks and settings**
- Never roll pacifists again.
- ~~Set a custom filth rate for humans.~~ (Removed in 1.3)
- Don't interact with animals just before their naptime.
- Animals marked for taming are less tasty to your guard-trained predators. ("Bad bear! I said tame the turtle, not eat it!")
- Increase the size of Herd Migrations. Bring on the herd!

**Mods for modders**
- Remove the 6 second cooldown on workshop submissions
- Devmode spawn tweaks. Pick the stuff and quality for the item you wish to spawn.
- ~~Remove the 999 messages limit. Because sometimes you want to get spammed~~. (Removed in 1.3)

Most things in the mod are optional which can be configured or turned off.
